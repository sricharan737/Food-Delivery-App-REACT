-What is NPM ? 
NPM has no true full form, but it is a node package manager which mamages different packages and libraries needed for the app to run. I tinstalls the needed
node modules for the app.

-What is Parcel/Webpack and why do we need it ?
Parcel is a bundler which is one of the most important component in the app, we need it for multiple reasons like:
- Making the code optimized, tree shaking, multiple browser support, dev build, it gives us a local server for us to host
Faster builds, Caching, Hot module replacement, File Watching algorith and many more uses

-What is parcel-cache?
Its the cache memory used to make the project server to run faster and stores all the instances of the project for any change made to reflect in server

-What is 'npx'?
It is used to execute a particular library in npm for example we use it to run any parcel commands

-What is the differce between dependencies and devdependencies ?
devdependencies are dependencies needed during the dev phase and not required for prod, where as the regular dependencies are required for the overall app

-What is Tree Shaking?
Using parcel we get a feature called tree shaking which removes any unused code for example and depreciated functions, methods or variables.

-What is Hot Module Replacement?
Hot Module Replacement (HMR) exchanges, adds, or removes modules while an application is running, without a full reload. This can significantly speed up development in a few ways:

Retain application state which is lost during a full reload.
Save valuable development time by only updating what's changed.
Instantly update the browser when modifications are made to CSS/JS in the source code, which is almost comparable to changing styles directly in the browser's dev tools.

-What is .gitignore? 
it is a file which states which folders or files to exclude from being added to remote git as not all the files are needed to be added like:
node modules, parcel cache, dist etc which can be generated whenever needed.

-Difference between package.json and package-lock.json ?
package has all the required libraries and dependencies required for the project whereas package-lock has all the exact versions
for the dependencies with the version numbers and their dependencies to other dependencies.

-Why should I not modify package-lock ?
because you might mess up the cross relation of dependencies by changing any versions and might break the app.

-What is is dist folder?
It is the folder which has the running instance of the server if you check the files we can see that the compressed code is present after 
the prod version of code is hosted on the server.

-What is browserlists ?
This is added to the package json file to give different browsers the compatability, we can specify the versions for each or in general.
